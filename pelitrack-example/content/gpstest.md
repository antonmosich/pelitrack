This page could also be created without using GPSBabel, if you set the `PELITRACK_USE_GPSBABEL` to false. It then simply copies the gpx file from its
original location to the output folder. The downside is, that you can't reduce the filesize further through GPSBabel's filters or use other file formats
if you choose to not use GPSBabel.
